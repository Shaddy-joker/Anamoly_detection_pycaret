# PyCaret Anomaly Detection Project

## Overview
This project implements anomaly detection using PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library in Python. The project demonstrates the process of detecting anomalies in a dataset and then classifying the identified anomalies.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for this project.
- **PyCaret**: An open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting model results.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis (implicit in PyCaret's functionality).
- **Scikit-learn**: Underlying machine learning library used by PyCaret.
- **Google Colab**: The development environment used for this project.

## Key Components

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Used PyCaret's built-in anomaly dataset.
   - Set up the environment for anomaly detection using `setup()` function.

2. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Created a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model for anomaly detection.
   - Visualized the model results.
   - Generated predictions and assigned anomaly labels to the dataset.

3. **Classification of Anomalies**:
   - Set up a classification experiment using the anomaly-labeled dataset.
   - Compared multiple classification models to find the best performer.
   - Evaluated and visualized the best model (Decision Tree Classifier).

## What I Learned

1. **Low-Code Machine Learning**:
   - Understood the power and simplicity of using PyCaret for quick machine learning experiments.
   - Learned how to set up experiments, create models, and generate predictions with minimal code.

2. **Anomaly Detection Techniques**:
   - Gained hands-on experience with unsupervised anomaly detection using the KNN algorithm.
   - Learned how to interpret and visualize anomaly detection results.

3. **Model Comparison and Selection**:
   - Used PyCaret's `compare_models()` function to automatically train and evaluate multiple classification models.
   - Learned to interpret model comparison results and select the best model based on specific metrics (e.g., Recall).

4. **Model Evaluation and Visualization**:
   - Explored various evaluation metrics for classification models.
   - Learned to create and interpret important plots such as AUC curve and confusion matrix.

5. **Workflow for Anomaly Detection and Classification**:
   - Understood the process of first detecting anomalies and then classifying them.
   - Gained experience in preparing anomaly-detected data for subsequent classification tasks.

6. **Importance of Model Interpretability**:
   - Learned to use PyCaret's built-in visualization tools to understand model performance and results.

7. **Automated Machine Learning**:
   - Experienced how automated ML tools can quickly provide insights and baseline models for further refinement.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different anomaly detection algorithms available in PyCaret.
- Implement cross-validation for more robust model evaluation.
- Try feature engineering to improve model performance.
- Explore PyCaret's hyperparameter tuning capabilities for model optimization.
- Apply the learned techniques to real-world datasets with known anomalies.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrated the power of PyCaret in simplifying the machine learning workflow for anomaly detection and classification. It provided valuable insights into automated machine learning techniques and the process of detecting and classifying anomalies in data.
